# `chapter_ranges` lets you transform chapter indicators into range indicators.
#
# Chapter range definition syntax:
# ```
# start_pattern<color:opacity>end_pattern
# ```
#
# Multiple start and end patterns can be defined by separating them with `|`:
# ```
# p1|pN<color:opacity>p1|pN
# ```
#
# Multiple chapter ranges can be defined by separating them with comma:
#
# chapter_ranges=range1,rangeN
#
# One of `start_pattern`s can be a custom keyword `{bof}` that will match
# beginning of file when it makes sense.
#
# One of `end_pattern`s can be a custom keyword `{eof}` that will match end of
# file when it makes sense.
#
# Patterns are lua patterns (http://lua-users.org/wiki/PatternsTutorial).
# They only need to occur in a title, not match it completely.
# Matching is case insensitive.
#
# `color` is a `bbggrr` hexadecimal color code.
# `opacity` is a float number from 0 to 1.

# Display skippable youtube video sponsor blocks from https://github.com/po5/mpv_sponsorblock
# ```
# chapter_ranges=sponsor start<3535a5:0.5>sponsor end

#
# Display anime openings and endings as ranges:
# ```
# chapter_ranges=^op| op$|opening<968638:0.5>.*, ^ed| ed$|^end|ending$<968638:0.5>.*|{eof}
